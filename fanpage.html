                                Sonata Arctica started life as a hard rock band named Tricky Beans. They later changed the name to Tricky Means before settling on the name Sonata Arctica. They shifted to more of a power metal style, though they would experiment with many different styles over their discography.

                                The band has had many members over the years, with lead singer Tony Kakko and drummer Tommy Portimo being the only ones to have stayed since the band was founded. Their music is inspired by many different bands and genres. Their lyrics often tell dark and twisted stories, with subjects about fantastical beings, supernatural serial killers, and dark fairy tails. The bands mascot is a wolf, and every album features wolves in some way, either on the cover or in their songs.

                                They have released nine studio albums, with their most recent album, The Ninth Hour, being released on October 7, 2016.
